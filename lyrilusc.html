	<p class="intro">Named after crystals(ex. Beryl, Celestine, Cobalt, Sapphire, Turquoise), this little flock is made up of seemingly weak monsters,
	with all of them possessing 0, 100, or 200 as their ATK/DEF values(with the exception of Independent Nightingale).
	But their strength is in their numbers, by quickly swarming up the field,
	they allow the user to bring forth the cards that are named after gatherings(ex. Recital, Assembly, Ensemble, Prom).
	On first look, you would notice that even these gathering based cards, only possess 0 ATK/DEF, yet their effects/abilities,
	grant them not only special properties, but also stacking power based on the number of members used to bring them on the field.
	You may read of their respective effects(and summoning conditions for gatherings) by selecting them from the images below.</p>
