	<h1>This is a website project prepared with the goal of satisfying ECC006 class requirements of the developer.<br>
	It is shaped and designed with the developer's views,
	opinions and aims to showcase their personally favored card groupings in a card game.</h1>

		<p class=left>Yu-Gi-Oh! started out as a manga series written and illustrated by Kazuki Takahashi,
		serialized between September 1996 and March 2004. It is now a media franchise that spans multiple
		spin-off manga and anime series, numerous video games, as well as a Trading Card Game(TCG).
		Below you can see my favorite archetypes as well as some screenshots from one of the more recent YGO games,
		which brings the TCG onto the digital platform.</p>
		<p class=right>The TCG features a somewhat wide ruleset that takes time to master,
		and it features over ten thousand cards either with their own effects or flavor text.
		As such, I will not be trying to teach the game, rather, showcasing my favorite archetypes.
		Archetypes are, by definition, a group or series of cards with similar names and/or artworks.
		They often contain effects that support each other in some fashion.
		Below, you can see some of my favorite archetypes.</p>
		<a href="https://img.yugioh-card.com/en/downloads/rulebook/SD_RuleBook_EN_10.pdf">You can find the official rulebook here.</a>
		<p class=middle>Lyriluscs are designed after birds, they are named after crystals and gatherings. They embody strength in numbers.<br>
		Lunalights are designed after animals, they are warriors who bear crescent accessories and focus on battle prowess.<br>
		I will be inspecting several reptile based archetyes under this section; Venoms, Reptiliannes, Ogdoadics.<br>
		They are respectively based around Snake Venom, Reptiles, and fantasy-based primordial beings.<br>
		Shaddolls are designed after darker, puppet versions of cards from other archetypes,
		and they have references from the Kabbalah, an ancient Jewish mysticism.</p>
		<p>Below are some images from one of the more recent Yu-Gi-Oh games, which brings the TCG to digital platforms.</p>
