				<p>Yu-Gi-Oh! is a franchise full of crazy character designs and illogical hair styles,
				the character behaviors and scenes are overly dramatic as it serves a younger audience at heart,
				yet the game is overly complicated and brain jogging, and the mangas contain much darker depictions and scenarios
				for a more mature audience.</p>
				<p>This is not very surprising when you learn that the franchise was once supposed to start as a horror manga.
				In time, certain inspiration from mainstream concepts and plots, the author's decision to create a manga where
				the protagonist does not hit anybody, has lead the manga in a direction about games. Later with fan-feedback
				it reached it's final form;<br>A card-game manga where friendship, growth and development of one's self was the focus.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="desc">
				<p>The player base is mostly made up of teens and adults, and that is because of the sheer complexity and depth the game brings.
				The game ruleset isn't very hard at first, even welcoming, but through the 26 year journey the franchise went through,
				many different mechanics has made it into the game. Learning them can be quite taxing to newcomers, let alone mastering them.
				So as conflicting as it is to my previous statement, it can be quite difficult to learn if you don't have someone to guide you.
				With the right company, it can be taken step by step, and before you know it, you would be swallowed into a world of possibilities.</p>
				<p>What I like the most about the game's players is actually beyond the player base and the friendships it can actually build in real life
				like other card and tabletop games. But rather, with the right company, it presents a comforting competitive environment to grow,
				to explore and have fun.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="desc">
				<p>If you are wondering if you would like the cards, or the playstyle, or even the feel you are giving off to your opponent;</p>
				<p>The short answer is, yes. With over ten thousand cards, each player can find a unique theme,
				style and even playstyle befitting their personality, preference, and imagination.
				Experimental and experienced users can even custom tailor a mix of cards into a deck.
				There is something for everyone as there are archetypes(card groupings) of most things you can think on top of your mind.</p>
				<p>Certain animals and animal types, myths, stories, toys, robots, mechs, gods, outer beings, heroes, spies, primordial beings,
				puppets, horrors, aliens, warriors, pacts, wizards, dragons, foods, plushies, household appliances, the list goes on...</p>
				<p>Yet amongst everything about the cards, the best thing is the effect diversity. The same logic cannot always
				be applied to every deck and every duel. With diversity amongst cards, their interactions, the combos and loops that can be created
				keep the game alive and fresh for the players that utilize it. The fun in Yu-Gi-Oh, comes from the fact that you can keep
				learning and creating both on your own while working on your deck, and also truly mastering it during an actual duel.
				Always learning, improvising, and bettering both your ability, thinking, and your deck along the way is the true depth and joy of this game.
				Exchanging moves with an opponent that can take all you dish out and push you to your limits can be a great feeling to experience.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="desc">
				<p>Yu-Gi-Oh! is mostly played between two people, each person with a deck of their own, consisting of 40 to 60 cards.
				Each player may only have up to 3 copies of the same card in their deck and each player draws 5 cards in their opening hand.</p>
				<p>Assuming you have 3 of each 3 in your 40 card deck, the chance of you opening a 3 card combo is 0.39%.<br>
				Assuming that you have 3 of one, and 6 of one(3 of the same card, with 3 of an another filling the same purpose),
				the chance of you opening this 2 card combo would be 17.28%.</p>
				<p>When it comes down to it, building combos and conditional strategies that you can muster through a long lasting duel
				takes consideration, planning and mapping. The consistancy involved, is so important to some seasoned players or tournament participants,
				that the luck factor, is evaluated through countless test hands and solo play, as well as math,
				through Hypergeometric Probability Distribution.</p>
