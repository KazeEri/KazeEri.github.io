			<h2>Vennominaga of the Venoms</h2>
			<p>The Venom archetype is rarely played, and their boss monster is a rarer sight to behold in any player's deck.
			This is not as surprising as it sounds when you realise that her cons quite outweigh her pros.
			First we will break down the overwhelming process of summoning her, so that even a non-ygo player
			will be able to see the sheer amount of steps needed, and how tedious a task it is to finish.<br><br>
			The starting hand of a player is 5 cards, and except special conditions/effects, each player can summon once per turn.
			With these in mind, we first need to summon/keep two monster cards on our field. Then we sacrifice these two,
			to bring forth Vennominon, another one of the key cards required for Vennominaga. Then we need to have another one of the key-pieces
			in our hand, to set down prior to the next steps, called "Rise of the Snake Deity".
			Vennominaga can only be summoned with the use of this card, and the requirements to activate it are as follows;
			Our Vennominon that we have brought out to the field, must be destroyed via an effect(either by the opponent,
			or on purpose by us using another card that can accomplish this.). As this is a trap card,
			it must've also been set down a turn before it's activation. Only then, can we even use Vennominaga in the game.<br><br>
			As much as it can be a dream to imagine accomplishing all of the conditions during a real game as the opponent will not sit idly by.
			Once actually played, this is one of the most powerful cards in the game. Unaffected by other cards and their effects,
			it gains 500 ATK points for each Reptile card in our grave. When it is destroyed via battle,
			we can simply remove a Reptile from our grave forever, to bring her right back onto the field.<br><br>
			Her final speciality is her scariest yet, and it is that she possesses one of the rare external win conditions for the game.
			After she inflicts battle damage to the enemy three times, you simply win the Duel.</p>
			<p>Below you can find the original description of the card:<br>
			<br>Cannot be Normal Summoned/Set. Must be Special Summoned with "Rise of the Snake Deity" or by its own effect.
			Gains 500 ATK for each Reptile monster in your GY. Neither player can target this card with card effects,
			also it is unaffected by other cards and their effects. When this card is destroyed by battle and sent to the GY:
			You can banish 1 other Reptile monster from your GY; Special Summon this card.
			When this card inflicts battle damage to your opponent: Place 1 Hyper-Venom Counter on it.
			When the 3rd Hyper-Venom Counter is placed on this card, you win the Duel.</p>

			<img src="img/venom/ReptilianneMelusine2.png" alt="BG">
			<h2>Melusine of the Reptilianne</h2>
			<p>The Reptilianne archetype shines through restriction and control. When an opponent's monster activates their effect,
			Melusine possesses the ability to change their ATK value to 0. Not only leaving it devoid of any attack power,
			but also supporting the rest of her archetype as most other cards in this archetype possess effects that can destroy
			or act on beneficial ways against 0 ATK cards on the field.<br><br>
			Melusine is a Synchro card and as such, her summoning is fairly easy, it utilises the basic synchro summoning method from the rulebook.
			As a bonus, since a Reptilianne player's deck will mostly be filled with Reptile type cards,
			Melusine also obtains her conditional effect nearly everytime she is brought to the field;
			she has prevention against being destroyed by battle or effects.</p>
			<p>Below you can find the original description of the card:<br>
			<br>1 Reptile Tuner + 1+ non-Tuner monsters<br>
			If this card was Synchro Summoned using only Reptile monsters as material, it cannot be destroyed by battle or card effects.
			Once per Chain, when your opponent activates a monster effect, except during the Damage Step (Quick Effect):
			You can target 1 face-up monster your opponent controls; change its ATK to 0.
			If this Synchro Summoned card you control is sent to your GY by an opponent's card:
			You can add 1 Reptile monster from your Deck to your hand.</p>

			<img src="img/venom/OgdoabysstheOgdoadicOverlord2.png" alt="BG">
			<h2>Ogdoabyss of the Ogdoad</h2>
			<p>As Ogdoadic archetype is a rather new one, only having been released in 2021, I do not have enough experience and knowledge
			to go in depth with this group. But basically, their effects trigger when you have certain types or numbers of cards on the field
			or in the grave.<br><br>Their boss monster, Ogdoabyss, has the ability to summon itself from the grave as long as you have three monsters
			on the field to sacrifice. Though a costly requirement, while it is on the field, it can send all monsters from the field to the grave,
			except ones that have been summoned from the grave. What that means is, most Ogdoad cards, including itself, will be unaffected
			by this action due to their nature and summoning methods, while other archetype users will suffer and lose their monsters against
			this powerful move. You may only do this once per turn but it's 3100ATK power is a heavy blow against an empty field,
			reducing directly from the opponent's 8000 Life unless they were able to muster other measures to defend themselves for that turn.<br><br>
			In which case, until the opponent finds a way to remove it off the field, this card will keep ruling the battlefield
			by sending the opponent's card off the field repeatedly each turn.</p>
			<p>Below you can find the original description of the card:<br>
			<br>If this card is in your GY: You can Tribute 3 monsters; Special Summon this card.
			Once, while this card is face-up on the field (Quick Effect): You can send all monsters from the field to the GY,
			except face-up monsters Special Summoned from the GY.
			You can only use each effect of "Ogdoabyss, the Ogdoadic Overlord" once per turn.</p>
